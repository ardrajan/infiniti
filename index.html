                        <p class="h3">The assessment was traditionally administered using paper and pencil and the data was analyzed manually. The original mCLASS:CIRCLE application was available in two parts. Individual assessment of students was administered using a standalone application that ran on a number of devices running the Microsoft Windows OS. Results were synced and aggregate reporting and instructional next steps were available through a web portal, optimized for desktop browsers.

                        In order to stay relevant in the market, Amplify wanted to port the application to iOS and Android tablets.

                        <p class="h3">
                            As mentioned before, the software solution provided two different experiences – a standalone (offline) application for assessment and a web portal for analysis. This dual system was proving to be cumbersome for teachers because working with students’ data required the teacher to be necessarily online.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Secondly, some of the assessments required the student to respond to content presented on the screen. Each response of the student was to be discreetly marked as correct, incorrect or skipped. On devices that had keyboards, the teacher could use the keyboard keys to record the responses in the standalone application. However, since touch tablets do not ship with a keyboard, the mechanism for discreetly recording students’ responses would have to be redesigned.
                            <br/><br/>
                            In short, we had to re-think the entire system of assessment and analysis while making it relevant to touch devices.

                            In order to make the workshop fun and engaging, I created a theme around the DC Comics’ Superhero Universe.

                        <p class="h3">We choose RITE testing to test the prototypes with pre-K teachers. The process involved testing the prototypes with 2-3 users and immediately making changes to the designs based on user feedback. I worked with the User Researcher to come up with the goals and questions for each round of testing. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        For each test session, I was present along with the User Researcher and Product Owner. In addition, two developers from the team were invited for each session, so that they could directly hear feedback from teachers. Involving team members with the user testing sessions established empathy for the user across the team.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The RITE testing method was very useful in iterating very quickly to arrive at user-centric solutions with great experiences.</p>

We presented a couple of visual design options to our internal stakeholders before finalizing the visual design. Towards the end of our user testing session, we presented prototypes of user features with actual visual designs to see how users reacted.</p>

                        For mCLASS:CIRCLE, I worked with the development team in two-week sprints to create UI widgets for the front-end library in addition to front-end code for product features. In some cases, I also wrote Selenium tests for testing the front-end.</p>
